---------------------------------------------------------------

An efficient way, to obtain headers and libraries required by KidMon is using vcpkg from:
https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg

(1) Follow the vcpkg installation instructions found in README.md and clone vcpkg e.g. to a folder named "vcpkg"
    in the your source code directory, e.g. C:\src\vcpkg.
    cd vcpkg

(2) Install the headers and libraries the following way for 32-bit or 64-bit:
    .\vcpkg install rapidcsv --triplet x86-windows
    .\vcpkg install rapidcsv --triplet x64-windows
